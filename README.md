# Laboratory-inventory

This project was created as my final project during my Web Development bootcamp. It is an single-page web application that functions as an inventory management for a laboratory. It was built using React and Bootstrap for the front-end, with Express and Mongoose used to communicate with the database on MongoDB using a custom API with middleware and JWTokens used to authenitcate users.

(DISCLAIMER: As the application requires a MongoDBURI to operate, a local clone of the repo will not be able to completely function. To experience the working application go to <a href="https://laboratory-inventory.onrender.com" target="_blank">this website</a> )
